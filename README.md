**Chic Chain Analytics:**


Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. It is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers.

In this supply chain analytics analysis, the challenge was dealing with a dataset comprising 100 rows and 24 columns. During the Exploratory Data Analysis phase, quality control checks were performed, supply chain risks were assessed, Inventory Optimization Analysis was conducted using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method, customer segmentation analysis was carried out, and lead time optimization was explored. However, in the modeling phase, the use of Linear Regression, KNN, LightGBM and RNN models proved unsuitable for this small dataset, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes. To improve results in cost optimization and demand forecasting, it is recommended to either utilize a larger dataset or consider alternative methods such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests.
